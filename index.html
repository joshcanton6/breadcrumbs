        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Analyze Your Top Artists:</b> It starts by finding the artists you listen to the most, and gathers the music released by them. Find hidden gems or fresh beats!</li>
            <li><b>Customize Your Search:</b> You can choose a playlist to add more artists to the mix. Every artist in the selected playlist will be included in your search.</li>
            <li><b>Optional Filters:</b> Narrow down the selection of tracks to cater more to your listening needs. Want to choose certain artists? Only show popular songs? Maybe newest hits?</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Get Started</h2>
        <p>Connect your Spotify account to allow Breadcrumbs to analyze your listening history. Breadcrumbs offers a seamless way to discover new tracks that align with your tastes. By leveraging your listening history and saved songs, it curates a musical journey for you, built on the artists you've already come to enjoy!</p>

# Breadcrumbs (A Spotify Web Mix)
*Work in progress! Some features or functionality of the app may not be perfect.*

Breadcrumbs is a Spotify web application that helps you discover new music tailored to your preferences. Using your recent top artists, as well as other artists you already know and love, Breadcrumbs builds a collection of tracks for you. Perfect for exploring new music from your favorite artists or discovering under-the-radar hits!

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Your Top Artists:** It starts by finding the artists you listen to the most, and gathers the music released by them. Find hidden gems or fresh beats!

2. **Customize Your Search:** You can choose a playlist to add more artists to the mix. Every artist in the selected playlist will be included in your search.

3. **Optional Filters:** Narrow down the selection of tracks to cater more to your listening needs. Want to choose certain artists? Only show popular songs? Maybe newest hits?

## Get Started

Connect your Spotify account to allow Breadcrumbs to analyze your listening history. Breadcrumbs offers a seamless way to discover new tracks that align with your tastes. By leveraging your listening history and saved songs, it curates a musical journey for you, built on the artists you've already come to enjoy!
